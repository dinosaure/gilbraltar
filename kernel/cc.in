# @@CONFIG_TARGET_TRIPLE@@-cc: RPi4 wrapper for 'cc'.
# Generated by configure.sh at build time.
#
# Passes through to @@CONFIG_TARGET_CC@ for actual work. Defines all flags
# required for correct operation when building C code intended for inclusion in
# a RPi4 unikernel.
#
# Provides a '-z rpi4-abi=ABI' option to select the RPi4 bindings to use if
# linking. ABI defaults to 'stub' to accomodate non-Gilbraltar-aware build
# systems, such as GNU autoconf, which use 'cc'-as-linker to test for the
# presence of symbols.
